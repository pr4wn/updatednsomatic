#                        update-dnsomatic
#
# Perl script which updates DNS-O-Matic with your current IP address.
# Inspired from original code posted on the OpenDNS forum here...
# <http://forums.opendns.com/comments.php?DiscussionID=1135>
# 
# ... and hacked about by prawn: sean dot prawn at gmail dot com
# to specifically work with DNS-0-Matic.
#
# Overview:  Program visits http://myip.dnsomatic.com/ to get your IP
#            address.  If it has changed, it will perfom a web update
#            on the DNS-O-Matic site and store your new IP address in 
#            /etc/update-dnsomatic/myip.  Results are logged in 
#            the syslog.
#
#  Installing:  Edit the file config with at least your DNS-O-Matic
#               user id and password.  You may want to assign myhost
#               with your domain name if you only wish to update that
#               item.
#
#  As root or sudo:
#    
#  ./install.sh
#
# Perl Modules:
# You may need to install Crypt::SSLeay in order for the https access
# to work.  Debian based uses can install the module by:
#  
#  apt-get install libcrypt-ssleay-perl
#
# Other distibutions should read the documentation here:
#
# <http://search.cpan.org/src/DLAND/Crypt-SSLeay-0.57_01/README>
